## Hello! I'm Katerin Tello

I'm from Venezuela, currently living in Australia.

Iâ€™m a creative, punctual, and goal-oriented individual with strong values, excellent communication skills, and a passion for problem-solving.

I gained valuable experience with [**Laboratoria**](https://www.laboratoria.la/), developing web applications, and worked at [**Falabella**](https://www.falabella.com/), Latin America's leading e-commerce company, improving user experiences and optimizing digital solutions.

Specializing in **React.js**, I am skilled in **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js**, and **Git**, with a passion for agile environments and emerging technologies.


Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
